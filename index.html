            <blockquote>
                <p>"Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out." – Chris Pine</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Programming teaches us that life, like code, is a process of continuous problem-solving. It reminds us to approach challenges with curiosity and creativity, to break problems into manageable pieces, and to never fear failure because every error is a stepping stone to success.</p>
